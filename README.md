# Walk it Off

Project Description:
    We created an application that will offer an appropriate hike option for the user based on how many calories they want to burn off after having that extra snack they were craving. Let’s be honest, we all love food and sometimes we can’t help ourselves to seconds!

User Story:
    So you walk into a Dunkin Donuts, planning on just picking up your coffee for that morning, when you see the employee loading up the rack with freshly made jelly doughnuts. So you say, “what the heck, I’ll take a Jelly doughnut as well.” The cashier says to you “they just so happen to be 1 for a dollar but half a dozen for only \$2.”

    “Well, who can say no to that!” you respond…

    After demolishing a half a dozen jelly doughnuts for breakfast, you are filled with regret…. And jelly.
    Well then this app is for you.  We will help you determine a peaceful hike for the appropriate distance to BURN those calories away… like they never happened at all!

Usage:
    On the main webpage you should enter the snack that you ate, the quantity, your weight, and your zipcode. Then proceed to hit the submit button.

    You will then be prompted with a suggested hiking trail that is long enough to burn off the calories of whatever food you had to eat.
